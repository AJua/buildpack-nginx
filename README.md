# NGINX Buildpack

**Note**: This has only been tested with [dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) - it may not work elsewhere.

Simply use this as the Dokku buildpack for your static repo and push to your Dokku server!

Make sure you have a file called `.static` in your root folder of your application.
